-- Special Thanks To:
-- Cromzinc for all the suggestions on the UI and functionality
-- Beerhunter and Chairepoppa for testing where few would
-- Gistbek for suggesting adding top mythic+ level, <Esc> key for closing addon, and (hopefully adding mini-map icon)
-- To the guild Wasted Knights for putting up with my error prone programming
